    title: We Support and Collaborate with Stable Medical Homes
    description: >-
      Our partner health centers provide reliable comprehensive, quality primary
      care within their communities, effectively serving as medical homes. You
      can think of a medical home like a healthcare supermarket where patients
      and their families can go—close to their work and home lives—to get the
      care and  services they need to sustain better health.


      This centralized care is the most critical component of a healthcare
      safety net and demands expertise, reach, and resources that private
      physician offices and smaller medical practices cannot supply on their
      own. Healthcare LA, IPA works on multiple fronts to help by:

      Together with our partner health centers, we've built a sustainable
      medical home model that ensures all of our members in Los Angeles County
      have access to stable, compassionate, and effective care.
