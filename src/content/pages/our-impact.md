    description: >-
      HCLA IPA goes above and beyond by recognizing that accessing medical care
      is just one piece of a very complex process. Administrative and regulatory
      requirements and social determinants of health must all be addressed to
      elevate community health status and well-being.


      To that end, we provide our partner health centers with expertise,
      support, guidance, and access to administrative and technical resources,
      empowering them to remain in control of their practices while we
      collectively facilitate quality healthcare management.
