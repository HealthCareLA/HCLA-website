      The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is a care model that promotes care coordination and communication in order to provide better care and outcomes to patients. The National Center for Quality Assurance (NCQA) PCMH recognition model is the most widely adopted model in the country for transforming health centers into Patient-Centered Medical Homes. Research shows that NCQA recognized medical homes deliver higher quality care, help control costs and improve the service experience for both patients and physicians. <strong>Following are the Health Centers within the HCLA network that are currently recognized as NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Homes</strong>:
