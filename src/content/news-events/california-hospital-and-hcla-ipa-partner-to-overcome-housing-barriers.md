<p>Samaritan is a digital health intervention program that leverages a mobile app, an online community, and financial and social support to help people at risk for or experiencing homelessness to reach health and housing goals and meet other immediate needs. Health Care LA, IPA collaborated with the California Health Care Foundation and California Hospital Medical Center to implement the Samaritan pilot in five community health centers in the Los Angeles area. The pilot was a great success, with participating members experiencing meaningful financial and social support, improved health outcomes, and greater self-efficacy.</p>
